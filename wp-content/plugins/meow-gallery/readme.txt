Gallery system built for photographers, by photographers. Clean, focused, evolve naturally. Using the Masonry layout by default.

== Description ==

Gallery system built for photographers, by photographers. It's clean, focused, and will evolve naturally. It is responsive, retina and was built for the latest versions of WordPress. If you would like to see it performing, have a look at http://haikyo.org, all the galleries are using the default settings of Meow Gallery. On that website, the images are also synchronized with Lightroom through WP/LR Sync, everything works together.

**SIMPLE**. It works with the standard WP Gallery.

**LAYOUTS**. Many layouts will come, for now we only propose Masonry.

**EVOLUTION**. We realized that there are too many complicated gallery systems out there with a codebase so huge that it is impossible to improve. We will keep this gallery neat and it will never get bloated. We will be careful with every step we make and we might not be able to implement all your requests. This plugin is designed to work naturally with the WordPress core and all the plugins respecting the standards will definitely work with the Meow Gallery.

**LIGHTROOM**. Using WP/LR Sync with the WP Gallery setting, it will automatically creates those galleries in your posts or pages.
