== Description ==

Lightbox built for photographers, by photographers. Check the screenshots to see how beautiful our lightbox is :) If you want to see how it performs, have a look at one of my post on my website, for example this one: http://jordymeow.com/best-abandoned-places-2014/. Or with a gallery, in that case, any page on http://haikyo.org. Its official page is https://meowapps.com/meow-lightbox/.

**IMPORTANT**. By default, the selector is set on '.entry-content'. If your theme doesn't use it, you need to update the plugin options. The plugin will then look for images surrounded by links and apply the lightbox. When you insert images in your posts, make sure the "Link To" is set to "Media File" or to "Attachment Page".

**KEY FEATURES**
* Responsive Layouts. Look great on mobile, tablets and bigger screens.
* Responsive Images. Image resolution itself will adapt to the screen and device.
* 3 layouts x 2 themes. 6 combinations; more are on the way.
* Display Image / EXIF information. Shutter speed, aperture, camera, lens.

**BETA**. This plugin was created not so long ago. We need your feedbacks to improve this lightbox. We will keep it simple, nice and powerful. We however don't want to bloat it with too many options.

**BE KIND**. This plugin is new. Please don't attack us if it's not working for you, because we need your help :) Talk to us, and we will reply to you really quickly.
