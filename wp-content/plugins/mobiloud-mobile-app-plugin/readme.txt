[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk5KRpK-k1A]

= Do you take care of the mobile app submission? =
Yes, we handle the complicated submission process for you. But you can also do it yourself if you want to.

Would you like to submit your own mobile app? That’s possible too.

= I don't want to pay monthly. Can I pay once for a lifetime license instead? = 
Yes, we offer lifetime licenses for both iOS (iPhone app and iPad app included) and Android mobile apps. A Lifetime License gives you all rights to operate your mobile app on the App Store and Google Play, for life. Once you’ve paid the one-off license fee, you don’t need to pay any further service fees to ensure your mobile apps are live and operating.

With a Lifetime License you also get technical support, including bug fixes, for 12 months.

Read more: [Lifetime License explained – Get your mobile app with a one-time payment](https://www.mobiloud.com/help/knowledge-base/lifetime/)

= How long does it take to publish a mobile app with MobiLoud? =
From your order to submitting the information required to publish your mobile app we take 5-10 business days. Note Apple then takes 5-10 business days to approve your app for the App Store. Publishing on Google Play requires generally about a day for the store to update.

= Can I use Disqus or Facebook comments? =
Yes, you can use Disqus or Facebook for comments in your mobile app in place of the standard WordPress commenting system. You can change these settings from the MobiLoud / Settings / Content screen.

= Does MobiLoud help me build a mobile site? =
We don't provide a mobile site together with your app. It's a good idea to have a mobile site, so casual visitors can still have a decent experience on your site when using a mobile device. Of course, we recommend you also build a mobile app, to convert those casual visitors into loyal followers, increase your traffic and keep growing your audience.

= Can I use my own Apple or Google Play account? =
Yes, we recommend you register your own Apple developer account, though it's not requried. You can get yours [here](https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/).

= Is there a long term contract? =
No contracts here! You pay month-to-month, and if you're unhappy with the service, you can simply cancel by emailing us at [support@mobiloud.com](mailto:support@mobiloud.com). Simple. No risk.

= What are the Terms and Conditions? =
Here are our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.mobiloud.com/terms/?ref=plugindesc) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.mobiloud.com/privacy/?ref=plugindesc).


= What is a native mobile app? =
MobiLoud News apps, on every platform, are native mobile apps. Most competing solutions instead give you HTML5 apps. The big difference is in performance and user experience. Native mobile apps are fast, run smoothly on the mobile devices they are designed for, and make full use of each platform's capabilities. They're also easier to use, because they're designed to look and feel familiar on each mobile platform, be it iOS or Android. A mobile app allows your users to receive push notifications, share with a single tap, quickly comment on articles and access content offline. In short, if you want to impress your users, go native and build a real mobile app!
