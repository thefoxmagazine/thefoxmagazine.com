Give credit to the authors and contributors of your blog by showing their profile information in a fancy and minimalistic box within the post page.



== Description ==

Whatever your reason for having a blog, whether it’s for business or a personal hobby, it’s important to do it right. In order to boost SEO rankings, gain traffic and leads, you need to have great content on your blog.

When it comes to creating great content, it really does matter who is writing. Authorship provides significant benefits:

* Higher click through rates
* Higher visibility
* Higher page views
* Lower plagiarism
* Build trust
* Elevate the role of the writer
* Establish authority

Whether you are a re-known author or not, guest posting is a good strategy for growing your blog readership and platform. “Guest posting” means writing and publishing an article on someone else’s website or blog.

If you allow people guest-posting on your site, you need a way to give them credit for their content so it can be a win-win situation for both (you and your guest authors). Authorship is important to the reputation, professional advancement and financial support of bloggers.

[Molongui Authorship plugin](//molongui.amitzy.com/product/authorship "Molongui Authorship plugin") allows you to give credit to any author who writes in your blog, whether it has a registered user on your Wordpress installation or not (guest author). Check the plugin features below.

= Features =

* <strong>User profile enhancement</strong> - Now you can upload a profile image, define the user job position and company, set social media profile links and more.

* <strong>Author box</strong> - Display a fancy author box on all posts, all pages or just on those that you configure.
